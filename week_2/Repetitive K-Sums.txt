Alice thinks of a non-decreasing sequence of non-negative integers and wants Bob to guess it by providing him the set of all its K-sums with repetitions.

What is this? Let the sequence be {A[1], A[2], ..., A[N]} and K be some positive integer that both Alice and Bob know. Alice gives Bob the set of all possible values that can be genereated by this - A[i1] + A[i2] + ... + A[iK], where 1 ≤ i1 ≤ i2 ≤ ... ≤ iK ≤ N. She can provide the values generated in any order she wishes to. Bob's task is to restore the initial sequence.

Consider an example. Let N = 3 and K = 2. The sequence is {A[1], A[2], A[3]}. The sequence of its 2-sums with repetitions is {A[1] + A[1], A[1] + A[2], A[1] + A[3], A[2] + A[2], A[2] + A[3], A[3] + A[3]}. But its elements could be provided in any order. For example any permutation of {2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6} corresponds to the sequence {1, 2, 3}.

Input Format

The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. 
The description of T test cases follows. 
The first line of each test case contains two space separated integers N and K. 
The second line contains the sequence Si of all K-sums with repetitions of the sequence Alice initially thought of.

Constraints
1 <= T <= 10^5
1 <= N <= 10^5
1 <= K <= 10^9
2 <= Si <= 10^18

Note 
The total number of elements in any input sequence does not exceed 105 
Each element of each input sequence is non-negative integer not exceeding 1018. 
Each input sequence is a correct sequence of all K-sums with repetitions of some non-decreasing sequence of non-negative integers.

Output Format

For each test case, output a single line containing the space separated list of elements of the non-decreasing sequence Alice thinks of. If there are several possible outputs you can output any of them.

Sample case #00: When N = 1 and K = 3 the only K-sum is S[1] = 3 * A[1]. Hence A[1] = S[1] / 3 = 3 / 3 = 1.

Sample case #01: Since 6 + 6 = 12, 6 + 28 = 34, 28 + 28 = 56, then Alice indeed could think of the sequence {6, 28}.

Sample case #02: It corresponds to the example in the problem statement.
