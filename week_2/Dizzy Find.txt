Given a spirally sorted matrix with N * N elements and an integer X, your task is to find the position(Index) of this given integer X in the matrix if it exists, else print -1. Note that all the matrix elements are distinct.

Note:- brute force search in 2D matrix will not work.

Note:-In case you are using C,C++ make sure you use fast I/O methods. refer

Input Format

First line contains number of test cases T. Following T lines contains First line N then N * N matrix elements. Next line contains the search key in the matrix X.

Constraints

0 < T <= 30
0 < N <= 1000
0 < A[i][j] <= 1000000000
0 < x <= 1000000000
Output Format

For every single test case print the position row column (i j) of the element if present else -1 in a new line.

Sample Input 0

1
4
1 2 3 4
12 13 14 5
11 16 15 6
10 9 8 7 
9
Sample Output 0

3 1
Explanation 0

9 appears in row number 3 and column number 1 (0-based indexing) Thus, output is 3 1.

Sample Input 1

1
2
1 2
4 3
8
Sample Output 1

-1
Explanation 1

8 is not present in the matrix so return -1
